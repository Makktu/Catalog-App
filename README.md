# CATALOG APP

Old-school vanilla project to keep a simple catalog (US spelling) of all coding projects.

Use will be able to enter all coding project details and view the collection in various configurations of their choice.

E.g. date, language(s)/framework(s) used, viability, active status, etc.

The categories will be user-customisable, so the Catalog can be repurposed to serve any purpose in which a record of many things is required.
